Hi,

I am Udit Raikwar from Jabalpur, I have completed Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology branch from Jabalpur Engineering College with CGPA of 7.66 in 2017. I have completed Senior Secondary School from Kendriya Vidyalaya COD, Jabalpur with aggregate 79.40% in 2013.

During engineering I have worked on several individual projects for learning new technologies, ways to complete work in optimized ways and also for fun. In most of the projects I have used C, C++ programming languages and libraries like OpenCV and tools like Wireshark. Using OpenCV I have done couple of projects which includes gesture recognition. Below are short intro to my projects. 

I have done Google Summer of Code with Debian organisation in 2016.
Work that I have done during GSoC:
➢ Improve logging (log symbolic error names instead of numeric error number values). ENo 5 = INput/OUTput error
➢ Enable TLS SNI support for client and server connection. 
➢ Enable the client to send the SNI name in outgoing TLS connections to other servers.
➢ Detect if incoming connection request a specific hostname using SNI and reply with
the appropriate server certificate

Projects that I made during freetime :
Operate mouse with finger gestures
➢ Created a project to operate mouse and played snooker with the help of index finger
gestures using OpenCV C++ API.

Hand gesture recognition program
➢ Created a hand gesture recognition program using OpenCV with C++ API.

Keyboard pattern tracker
➢ Track graphically the keys pressed on keyboard using OpenCV with C++ API.

Found security leak in WeChat messaging app
➢ Found one security leak using which anyone can logged in to other's account and redeem their balance without knowing them.

Customized shortcut keys
➢ Made a program to capture pressed keys and perform task associated with that keys.
➢ Link: github(https://goo.gl/LbAVPf), youtube(https://youtu.be/xXnfW_pzV-c)

Some more projects are listed on github..

Thanks :)
